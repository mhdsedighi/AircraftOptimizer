# AircraftOptimizer
A MATLAB script for optimizing an aircraft design based on performance, with the support for morphing wing.
Airodynamics calculation is based on Torando VLM mathod.

for testing:
run initial to initiate a sample design and get a 3d plot
and then:
    main_aircraft_design to optimize a design cost for an aircraft
    or main_morph to optimize a design cost for a morphing (shape changing) aircraft
