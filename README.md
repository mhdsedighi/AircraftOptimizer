# AircraftOptimizer
A MATLAB script for optimizing an aircraft design based on performance, with the support for morphing wing.

for testing:
run initial(NUM) to initiate a sample design and get a 3d plot
and then Main(NUM) to optimize a design cost


run initial8 for initiating a design
run main 8 to optimize a morphing-wing airplane based on performance
